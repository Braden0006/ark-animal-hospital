            <h2 class="doctor_bio_title">Family</h2>
            <p class="doctor_bio_para">In his spare time, Dr. Thorne enjoys spending time with his family: vacationing,
                camping, hiking, ice skating, bowling, and swimming. Scott and his wife, Christine,
                are blessed to have three beautiful daughters, Madeline Kayo (2005), Katie Grace (2010), and
                Sydney Ryan (2012).  Since 2007, the Casper community has truly become home to the family. 
                They are members of Casper Alliance Church and are active in its Bible study small groups.  During
                the colder months, Scott enjoys playing ice hockey with the Casper Storm Hockey club and in the
                warmer months he enjoys playing golf and summer evening activities. The family currently has three
                cats, Jack, Mitty and Hobbes.

            <h2 class="doctor_bio_title">Experience</h2>
            <p class="doctor_bio_para">For over 20 years of veterinary practice, Dr. Thorne has had the opportunity and
                privilege to work at a few different multi-doctor small animal veterinary hospitals in Pennsylvania
                and Casper, gaining and developing a broad base of experience.  Those experiences include routine
                medical care, preventative medicine, internal medicine, dental care, surgery, emergency and
                critical care medicine and more.  Dr. Thorne is excited to continue to provide
                quality and compassionate veterinary care to the Casper community, building positive long-term relationships
                with clients and their animal companions.
